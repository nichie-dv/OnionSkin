# Onion Skin

This mod brings the popular onion skin animation tool to Geometry Dash using editor layers.

## Features
* Lower editor layers turn red
* Higher editor layers turn blue
* Layer opacity decreases based on distance from current editor layer
* Customizable colors and opacity values
* Many other QOL settings

To use, simply toggle the onion button found next to the editor layer controls.

## Custom Keybinds
Because `F9` is a vanilla keybind now, the `Shift` Modifier is added by default. The Base Keybinds can be changed however.
This mod adds 2 new editor keybinds:
- `Shift + F9` - toggle past frames
- `Shift + F10` - toggle future frames

These keybinds can be changed from the Mod settings.
